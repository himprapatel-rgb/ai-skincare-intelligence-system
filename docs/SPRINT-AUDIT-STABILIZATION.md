## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE (NEW STANDARD)

**A story is DONE when ALL of the following are true:**

1. ✅ **Code Written** - Logic implemented in backend/frontend
2. ✅ **Router Mounted** - API endpoint accessible via HTTP (for backend)
3. ✅ **Tests Pass** - At least 1 automated test (unit or integration)
4. ✅ **CI Passes** - All quality gates enabled and passing
5. ✅ **Code Reviewed** - Approved by at least 1 other engineer
6. ✅ **Deployed** - Live on Railway/Vercel
7. ✅ **Verified** - Smoke test passes against live URL
8. ✅ **Documented** - API spec updated (for backend features)

**Not Done = Not Deployed + Verified**

## 🧪 TEST STRATEGY

### Unit Tests
- **Tool:** Pytest
- **Target:** Business logic, utilities
- **Coverage Goal:** 70%
- **Run Frequency:** Every commit (CI)

### Integration Tests
- **Tool:** Pytest + TestClient (FastAPI)
- **Target:** Database interactions, API endpoint flows
- **Coverage Goal:** All critical paths
- **Run Frequency:** Every PR

### Smoke Tests
- **Tool:** Pytest + Requests OR Newman
- **Target:** Each API endpoint (assert non-500 response)
- **Coverage Goal:** All mounted endpoints
- **Run Frequency:** Post-deployment (CI)

### E2E Tests
- **Tool:** (Phase 2) Playwright
- **Target:** Full user journeys
- **Coverage Goal:** 3-5 critical user flows
- **Run Frequency:** Nightly

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] CI passes (all checks enabled)
- [ ] Code review approved (2 engineers)
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Deployment runbook reviewed

### Deployment Steps
1. Merge PR to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers Railway deployment
3. Wait for Railway build to complete
4. Automated health check runs
5. Newman smoke tests execute
6. Monitor error rates for 15 minutes

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200
- [ ] All smoke tests pass
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] Key endpoints responding < 2s

### Rollback Procedure
If health check or smoke tests fail:
1. Revert Railway to previous deployment
2. Investigate failure in logs
3. Create hotfix branch
4. Test fix thoroughly
5. Re-deploy with verification

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Router mounting breaks existing APIs | HIGH | MEDIUM | Test each router individually, gradual rollout |
| Black formatter introduces bugs | MEDIUM | LOW | Code review all formatting changes |
| Stakeholders reject reality check | HIGH | MEDIUM | Prepare data-driven presentation, focus on path forward |
| Railway deployment issues | HIGH | LOW | Have rollback plan ready, test in staging first |
| Team velocity overestimated | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Track daily, adjust mid-sprint if needed |
