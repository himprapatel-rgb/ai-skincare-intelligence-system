## 🔗 Section 2: Integration Testing

### 2.1 End-to-End Inference Flow

**Scenario 1: Successful External Inference**
```gherkin
Given a valid user authentication token
And an external model "huggingface/skin-analysis-v2" is configured
When I POST to /api/v1/inference/external with image_url
Then I receive 200 OK
And response contains model_version
And response contains results.conditions
And response time is <3 seconds (P95)
```

**Scenario 2: Fallback to Internal Model**
```gherkin
Given external model provider is unavailable
When I POST to /api/v1/inference/external
Then circuit breaker opens after 5 failures
And system falls back to internal model
And response contains fallback: true
And inference completes successfully
```

### 2.2 Model List Endpoint Tests

**Test Cases**:
1. ✅ GET /api/v1/models returns all models
2. ✅ Filter by type=internal
3. ✅ Filter by type=external  
4. ✅ Filter by active_only=true
5. ✅ Response includes cost_per_request
6. ✅ Response includes avg_latency_ms

### 2.3 Database Integration Tests

**Test Cases**:
1. ✅ Model version stored in inference_results
2. ✅ External model metadata stored correctly
3. ✅ Query by model_version works
4. ✅ Inference history filtering by model

## ⚡ Section 3: Performance Testing

### 3.1 Load Testing

**Test Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Sustained Load**
- Duration: 30 minutes
- RPS: 50 requests/second to /inference/external
- Expected: P95 latency <3s, success rate >99.5%

**Scenario 2: Spike Test**
- Ramp from 10 to 100 RPS in 1 minute
- Sustain 100 RPS for 5 minutes
- Expected: No failures, latency degradation <20%

**Scenario 3: Stress Test**  
- Gradually increase to system limits
- Identify breaking point
- Expected: Graceful degradation, no crashes

**Load Testing Tool**: Locust or k6

```python
# Locust test example
class ExternalModelUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def external_inference(self):
        self.client.post("/api/v1/inference/external", json={
            "image_url": "https://test.com/img.jpg",
            "model_name": "huggingface/skin-analysis-v2"
        })
```

### 3.2 NFR Validation Tests

**NFR-ML-1: Model Loading Performance**
- Test: Load 10 different models
- Measure: Time to load each
- Assert: <5s (small), <15s (medium), <30s (large)

**NFR-ML-2: Inference Latency**
- Test: 1000 inference requests
- Measure: P50, P95, P99 latencies
- Assert: P95 <3s, P99 <5s

**NFR-ML-3: API Reliability**
- Test: Simulate external API failures
- Measure: Retry attempts, fallback triggers
- Assert: 99.5% success rate

**NFR-ML-4: Cost Management**
- Test: Exceed daily budget
- Assert: Requests blocked, alerts triggered
