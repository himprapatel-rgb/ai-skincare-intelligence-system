## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)
1. ✅ Mount existing routers in `main.py`
2. ✅ Verify auth endpoints work on Railway
3. ✅ Update this matrix weekly
4. ✅ Stakeholder meeting: Reset expectations

### SHORT-TERM (2 Weeks)
1. Complete Sprint AUDIT-FIX
2. Implement 3 critical EPICs at MVP level:
   - EPIC 2: Basic scan + mock AI response
   - EPIC 3: Simple digital twin storage
   - EPIC 6: Hardcoded routine templates
3. Add health check endpoint
4. Create deployment verification tests

### MEDIUM-TERM (1 Month)
1. Achieve 20% overall completion (130 requirements)
2. Complete all CRITICAL EPICs at MVP level
3. Establish realistic velocity (10-15 points/sprint)
4. Re-baseline roadmap

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

**For Product Managers:**
- Use this matrix for sprint planning
- Update status after each sprint retrospective
- Track velocity against realistic baselines

**For Engineers:**
- Check router mounting status before claiming "complete"
- Add tests before marking any feature done
- Update status when deploying to Railway

**For QA:**
- Use "Verified" column to track testing
- Create test cases for all ✅ entries
- Block deployment if verification fails

**For Stakeholders:**
- Red EPICs = not usable by end users
- Yellow EPICs = partial functionality, needs work
- Green EPICs = fully working and tested
