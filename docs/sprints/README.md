# Sprint Summaries

## Purpose

This folder contains **canonical sprint summaries** - the single source of truth for what each sprint delivered.

## Two-Tier Sprint Documentation Strategy

### Tier 1: Authoritative Sprint Records (THIS FOLDER)
- **ONE file per sprint**
- Immutable after sprint close
- Contains: goals, scope, deliverables, production status
- Linked from main README

### Tier 2: Sprint Evidence & History
- Lives in: `/docs/Archive/Sprint-History/`
- Phase docs, CI/CD proofs, intermediate reports
- Referenced by link from sprint summaries
- NEVER used as canonical truth
