# 🎯 YOUR ACTION PLAN - TODAY
## CRITICAL: Fix Production Issues IMMEDIATELY

**Date:** Tuesday, December 23, 2025, 9:00 AM GMT  
**Current Status:** 🚨 CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED - Router Duplication + Unreachable GDPR Features  
**Next Phase:** Emergency Backend Fix → Deploy → Frontend Sprint Planning  
**MVP Readiness:** 32% Complete (Updated from audit)

---

## ⚡ TLDR - DO THIS NOW (Next 4 Hours)

### Step 1: Fix Router Duplication (30 minutes) - **CRITICAL P0**

```bash
# 1. Open backend/app/main.py
# 2. DELETE lines 43 and 49 (scan.router and products.router)
# 3. They're already in api_router from backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py
```

### Step 2: Mount Missing GDPR Routers (15 minutes) - **LEGAL RISK P0**

```bash
# In backend/app/main.py, ADD these lines around line 50:
from app.routers import consent, profile
app.include_router(consent.router, prefix="/api/v1", tags=["consent"])
app.include_router(profile.router, prefix="/api/v1", tags=["profile"])
```

### Step 3: Test Locally (30 minutes)

```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test in new terminal:
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scan  # Should work
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/consent  # Should now work!
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/profile  # Should now work!
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/products  # Should work
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Railway (15 minutes)

```bash
git add backend/app/main.py
git commit -m "fix(critical): Remove duplicate router mounts + add consent/profile routers

- Remove scan.router duplicate (already in api_router)
- Remove products.router duplicate (already in api_router)
- Mount consent.router for GDPR compliance (FR44-FR46)
- Mount profile.router for user management

Fixes: Router conflicts causing 500 errors
Adds: Legal compliance endpoints"

git push origin main

# Railway will auto-deploy
# Monitor: https://railway.app/project/<your-project>
```

### Step 5: Verify Production (10 minutes)

```bash
# Test your Railway URL:
curl https://<your-app>.up.railway.app/api/health
curl https://<your-app>.up.railway.app/api/v1/consent
curl https://<your-app>.up.railway.app/api/v1/profile
```

## 📋 FULL DAY PLAN - Tuesday Dec 23

### ⏰ 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Emergency Backend Fixes

**Owner:** Backend Lead  
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Review audit findings in docs/AUDIT-REPORT.md
2. ⬜ Fix router duplication in main.py
3. ⬜ Add consent.py and profile.py routers
4. ⬜ Remove unsafe `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` from main.py
5. ⬜ Test all endpoints locally

**Files to Edit:**
- `backend/app/main.py` (remove lines 43, 49; add consent & profile; remove create_all)

**Expected Outcome:**
- No duplicate routes
- GDPR endpoints accessible
- All tests pass

---

### ⏰ 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Deploy + Production Verification

**Owner:** DevOps + QA  
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Tasks:**
1. ⬜ Commit and push fixes
2. ⬜ Monitor Railway deployment
3. ⬜ Run smoke tests on production
4. ⬜ Check Railway logs for errors
5. ⬜ Update deployment status in docs

**Smoke Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Scan endpoint works (no duplicate error)
- [ ] Consent endpoint works (newly added)
- [ ] Profile endpoint works (newly added)
- [ ] Products endpoint works (no duplicate error)
- [ ] Admin endpoints secure
- [ ] No 500 errors in logs

### ⏰ 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: LUNCH BREAK

### ⏰ 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Database Migration Audit

**Owner:** Backend Lead + DevOps  
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Tasks:**
1. ⬜ Run `alembic current` to check migration status
2. ⬜ Compare backend/models/*.py vs migrations/versions/
3. ⬜ Identify orphaned models (exist but no migration)
4. ⬜ Create migrations for missing tables:
   - ingredients_reference
   - ingredient_skin_effects  
   - product_skin_suitability
   - user_skin_outcomes
   - experiments
5. ⬜ Test migrations on local database
6. ⬜ Document migration status

**Expected Outcome:**
- All models have corresponding migrations
- Safe to deploy schema changes
- Migration history clean

---

### ⏰ 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM: Frontend Sprint Planning

**Owner:** Product Owner + Frontend Lead + UX  
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Tasks:**
1. ⬜ Review missing pages from audit:
   - OnboardingPage.tsx
   - ProfileSettingsPage.tsx
   - ConsentManagementPage.tsx
   - DigitalTwinTimelinePage.tsx
   - MyShelfPage.tsx
   - RoutineBuilderPage.tsx
   - ProgressDashboardPage.tsx
   - ProductScannerPage.tsx

2. ⬜ Prioritize pages for Sprint 6:
   - P0: OnboardingPage (blocks user registration flow)
   - P0: ProfileSettingsPage + ConsentManagementPage (legal requirement)
   - P1: MyShelfPage (core feature)
   - P1: DigitalTwinTimelinePage (core feature)
   - P2: RoutineBuilderPage
   - P2: ProgressDashboardPage
   - P2: ProductScannerPage

3. ⬜ Create user stories for Sprint 6 in Product-Backlog-V5.md
4. ⬜ Design wireframes for P0 pages
5. ⬜ Estimate story points (aim for 40-50 points for 2-week sprint)
6. ⬜ Schedule Sprint 6 kickoff for Dec 24

**Expected Outcome:**
- Sprint 6 backlog ready
- Wireframes approved
- Team aligned on priorities
