# SPRINT 1: CORE MVP DEVELOPMENT
# AI Skincare Intelligence System - First Feature Slice

**Project:** AI Skincare Intelligence System  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 - Core MVP Development  
**Duration:** 2 weeks (10 business days)  
**Status:** Development Phase  
**Last Updated:** December 1, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 1 is the first development sprint following the completion of Sprint 0 foundations. This sprint delivers a minimum viable product (MVP) slice: a functional prototype where users can register, log in, capture face images, upload them to the backend, receive simulated ML analysis results, and view those results in a clean UI.

By the end of Sprint 1, the AI Skincare Intelligence System will have a working, demonstrable prototype that validates the core user journey: registration → skin profile onboarding → scan capture → ML analysis → result display → data persistence.

---

## Sprint 1 Context & Strategic Goals

### Why Sprint 1?

Sprint 0 has completed all foundational work:
- ✅ Technical environment is live (Render, Neon, Cloudflare R2, GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Team workflows and ceremonies established
- ✅ Database schema and API architecture defined
- ✅ Design system and wireframes approved
- ✅ ML datasets bootstrapped and ready for training

Sprint 1 builds the first real features on top of these foundations.

### Sprint 1 Goals (Primary)

1. **Deliver User Accounts** - Secure registration, login, password reset, JWT token management
2. **Implement Scan Flow** - Camera UI, face alignment helper, image capture/upload to R2
3. **Create ML Stub API** - Backend returns simulated skin analysis scores (redness, acne, pigmentation, dehydration, sensitivity, confidence)
4. **Store & Retrieve Data** - User and scan metadata persisted in Neon PostgreSQL with proper indexing
5. **Build Core UI** - Navigation, result display, responsive design using design tokens
6. **Ensure Quality** - Unit tests (≥80% critical path), integration tests, staged deployment, zero critical Sentry errors

---

## Optimization Principles

- **Time-box to 2 weeks** - Fixed sprint duration forces prioritization and delivery discipline
- **Stub-first approach** - Use simulated ML results so frontend and backend develop in parallel (stub designed to swap with real model in Sprint 2 without UI changes)
- **Definition of Done enforcement** - Every feature must pass code review, peer-reviewed tests, staging deployment, and QA sign-off
- **JWT Security First** - Implement secure token-based auth (bcrypt hashing, httpOnly cookies, token blacklist) from Sprint 1 to avoid rework
- **Daily standups** - Catch blockers early & maintain team alignment
- **Zero critical blockers gate** - Sprint 1 closes only when all stories meet DoD and all acceptance criteria verified

---

## Sprint 1 Scope: 15 User Stories Across 5 Epics

### EPIC 1: User Accounts & Authentication (5 Stories)

#### Story 1.1: User Registration - Secure Email Signup

**As a** new user,  
**I want to** create an account with email and password,  
**So that** I can securely access my personalized skincare insights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Frontend:**
  - Registration form with email, password, confirm password, terms checkbox
  - Real-time password validation (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char) + show strength meter
  - Email format validation (RFC 5322) and duplicate email check via backend
  - Error handling: User-friendly messages (never reveal security details)
  - Store JWT in httpOnly cookie → auto-login, redirect to onboarding

- **Backend:**
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/register` validates input → returns `userid` + JWT token (24hr expiry)
  - Hash password using bcrypt (salt rounds = 12) — never store plaintext
  - Return 201 (created), 400 (bad request), 409 (conflict for duplicate)
  - Log registration event in `audit_logs` (user_id, action, timestamp, status, IP)

- **Database:**
  - Insert into `users` table: `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

- **Security:**
  - HTTPS-only, validate CSRF token

**Story Points:** 5  
**Owner:** Backend + Frontend pair

---

#### Story 1.2: User Login - Secure Session Management

**As a** registered user,  
**I want to** log in with email and password,  
**So that** I can securely access my scans and recommendations.

  - Store JWT in httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookie
  - Log login events (success/failure, timestamp, IP) in `audit_logs`
  - Error handling: Generic "Invalid email or password" (prevent user enumeration)

- **Tests:**
  - Successful login, wrong password, non-existent user, rate limiting, token refresh, expiry

## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Camera API inconsistency (iOS/Android/Web) | Medium | High | Day 1 spike: Test camera + ml5.js across all platforms. Fallback: gallery upload (Story 2.2). |
| DB connection pooling under load | Medium | High | Stress test Neon with 100+ concurrent connections (Week 1). Pool size = 20. Monitor latency. |
| R2 upload timeout (>10 sec for 5MB) | Low | High | Exponential backoff + retry (3 attempts). Test 5MB files Week 1. Timeout threshold = 15 sec. |
| JWT token edge cases | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive token tests (expiry, refresh, blacklist). Test all scenarios (Story 1.4) before deploy. |
| Scope creep (mid-sprint requests) | High | High | Strict backlog enforcement (PO reviews all requests). Defer to Sprint 2. Weekly scope freeze (Tue). |
| New team member with FastAPI/JWT | Medium | Medium | Pair new dev with auth lead for Stories 1.1-1.4. Security-aware code review before merge. |

### Escalation Protocol

If any story is **≥2 days behind schedule**:
1. Notify tech lead + product lead immediately
2. Options: reduce scope, add resource, extend sprint (not preferred)
3. Document decision and rationale
